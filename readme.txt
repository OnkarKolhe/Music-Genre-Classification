Project: Music genre recognition

We have used knn(k-nearest neighbour algorithm) for this code.The dataset contains audio files from which we extract the feature mfcc(mel frequency cepstral coefficient) and form our own training model.This is done in music-classification.py and we are testing if our training model works properly or not , we are using test.py to actually test the model by giving input to program a unknown genre audio file and according to model we have formed it classifies the audio file in respective category.


To run project:

We are providing .ipynb files of the project.So it will be easier to run the project on jupyter notebook.First run music-classification.py and then run the test.py.
